# Grading Interface Contract - SPI Master Verification Project

This file is **normative**. Any student submission that violates a **MUST**
clause in this file forfeits the corresponding rubric item.

## 1. File-system contract

Your submission zip must unpack to a single top-level directory named
`<name>_<id>/` that contains at minimum:

```
<name>_<id>/
  tb/                    # testbench top-level file(s)
  env/                   # agents, scoreboard, coverage, reference model
  tests/                 # test classes / programs
  sequences/             # stimulus sequences
  assertions/            # SVA bind files (or inline in env/)
  docs/
    test_plan.pdf
    final_report.pdf
    coverage_report.pdf  # exported after `make cov`
  Makefile               # MUST inherit the targets below
  README.md              # how to run, toolchain notes
```

Additional folders are allowed but are ignored by the grader.

The directory layout is mandatory regardless of methodology. An SV-only
submission populates the *same* folders but with SystemVerilog programs
and modules instead of UVM class libraries (see Section 10).

## 2. Required Makefile targets (MUST)

Your `Makefile` MUST support exactly the following invocations, with no
additional positional arguments required:

| Target | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `make compile` | Compile the testbench and the DUT sources given by `DUT_SRCS` |
| `make run TEST=<name> SEED=<n>` | Run a single test with the given seed |
| `make regress` | Run the full regression list, once per `REGRESSION_SEEDS` |
| `make run_bonus` | Run the mandatory RAL bonus test `ral_hw_reset_test` |
| `make cov` | Produce `coverage_report.txt` at the repo root |
| `make clean` | Remove build artefacts |

The grader will invoke:

```bash
make clean
make compile DUT_SRCS="<abs_path_to_spi_core_buggy> \
                       <abs_path_to_apb_regfile_buggy> \
                       <abs_path_to_spi_master_buggy>"
make regress DUT_SRCS="..." REGRESSION_SEEDS=<N>
make cov
```

`REGRESSION_SEEDS` is bounded such that **total runs <= 10000**.

### DUT_SRCS vs DUT_SRC

The DUT now has three RTL files (`spi_core.sv`, `apb_regfile.sv`,
`spi_master.sv`) that together implement the IP. The grader passes the
whole list via `DUT_SRCS`.

For backward compatibility the grader's older single-file override
`DUT_SRC=<one file>` is still honoured by the template Makefile: if
`DUT_SRC` is non-empty it replaces `DUT_SRCS` completely. Students MUST NOT
set `DUT_SRC` themselves.

### run_bonus

`make run_bonus` runs a test whose name is fixed to `ral_hw_reset_test`
(i.e. the Makefile variable `BONUS_TEST` defaults to this). Students who
do not attempt the RAL bonus SHOULD keep a stub test under that name that
prints `[TEST_SKIPPED] ral_hw_reset_test`; the grader's RAL detector then
counts zero for the bonus and the rest of the rubric is unaffected.

## 3. Required test names (MUST implement)

Your regression MUST include, at minimum, the following ten tests. Test names
are case-sensitive and must match exactly:

1. `sanity_test` - enable, single byte transfer in mode 0, verify RX
2. `reg_access_test` - reset-value + write-read for every R/W register
3. `mode_coverage_test` - all 4 modes x {MSB-first, LSB-first} x {8,16,32}
4. `width_coverage_test` - edge cases at width boundaries
5. `fifo_stress_test` - push/pop near full/empty, back-to-back transfers
6. `interrupt_test` - each of the 5 interrupts: assert, mask, W1C, W1C race
7. `clk_div_corner_test` - DIV = 0, 1, small, large (>= 1024)
8. `loopback_test` - loopback set; external MISO driven nonsense; RX==TX
9. `delay_transfer_test` - DELAY > 0 inserts idle cycles between transfers
10. `error_injection_test` - TX write when full, RX read when empty, illegal
    width encoding, access to reserved offsets

You MAY add more tests (bonus regression coverage). Any additional test added
to `REGRESSION_TESTS` in the Makefile is run by the grader.

## 4. Log message contract (MUST)

The grader recognises a bug catch **if and only if** at least one of the
following appears in the test log, on its own line (leading whitespace
allowed):

- `[SCOREBOARD_ERROR] <free text>` - mismatch in predicted vs observed
- `[ASSERTION_ERROR] <assertion name> <free text>` - SVA failure
- `[CHECKER_ERROR] <check name> <free text>` - explicit `$error` from a check
- Any standard Questa/VCS `** Error:` or `UVM_FATAL` / `UVM_ERROR` line from
  your own code is also accepted.

At the end of each test, your TB MUST print exactly one of:

- `[TEST_PASSED] <test_name>` - zero errors, all expected events seen
- `[TEST_FAILED] <test_name> errors=<n>` - at least one error

The grader uses these lines to count passes/fails independently from the
bug-detection count.

## 5. Coverage contract (MUST)

- `coverage_report.txt` must be produced by `make cov` after a full regression
- The report MUST include total functional and code coverage numbers
- The grader parses the last occurrence of lines of the form
  `Total Coverage: <pct>%` and `Functional Coverage: <pct>%`
- Coverage gate: functional >= 85% and code (statement/branch) >= 85% on the
  **golden** RTL. This gate is checked in a separate grader pass using
  `DUT_SRC=<path to golden>`

## 6. Runtime contract (MUST)

- `make regress` must finish in **at most 10000 simulation invocations**.
  Total runs = `|REGRESSION_TESTS| x REGRESSION_SEEDS`.
- A single test must finish in at most 10 minutes of wall time on the grading
  machine (reasonable modern 8-core). Timeouts are treated as test failures.
- Tests must be deterministic given `+SEED=<n>` - the grader re-runs failing
  tests once to verify.

## 7. UVM bonus contract (OPTIONAL, strictly enforced)

If you attempt the UVM bonus, the grader runs **structural** checks on
your source tree. All of the following MUST be observed for the UVM
bonus to apply:

1. `tb/tb_top.sv` (or any file under `tb/`) contains `import uvm_pkg::*;`
   AND calls `run_test()`; the default test name passed to `run_test`
   MUST be one of your own `uvm_test` subclasses.
2. At least one class in `env/` extends `uvm_env` and defines a
   `build_phase` that calls `uvm_config_db#(virtual <iface>)::get(...)`
   at least once for the APB virtual interface.
3. At least one test in `tests/` registers a `uvm_factory` type override
   via `set_type_override_by_type` (or `set_inst_override_by_type`) at
   build time. Comment-only overrides do not count.
4. A `uvm_subscriber`-derived (or `uvm_analysis_imp`-based) coverage
   collector exists in `env/` and is instantiated somewhere inside the
   `uvm_env`.

If UVM RAL is used, you additionally qualify for the RAL bonus if ALL of
the following hold:

1. A class in `env/` extends `uvm_reg_block` and declares nine
   `uvm_reg` handles whose names match the register map in the spec
   (`CTRL`, `STATUS`, `TX_DATA`, `RX_DATA`, `CLK_DIV`, `SS_CTRL`,
   `INT_EN`, `INT_STAT`, `DELAY`).
2. An `add_hdl_path`/`configure`/`add_hdl_path_slice` call wires the
   backdoor paths to `dut_wrapper.u_dut.u_regfile.*` (the exposed DUT
   hierarchy). Backdoor access MUST be demonstrated at runtime - a
   single `UVM_BACKDOOR` read/write is sufficient.
3. `tests/ral_hw_reset_test.sv` (exactly that filename, class name
   `ral_hw_reset_test extends uvm_test`) runs `uvm_reg_hw_reset_seq`
   against the register block and prints `[TEST_PASSED] ral_hw_reset_test`
   on the golden RTL.
4. `make run_bonus` succeeds on the golden RTL.

The grader performs these checks via:
- Regex/AST search across `tb/`, `env/`, `tests/`.
- An actual `make run_bonus DUT_SRCS=<golden>` invocation. The RAL bonus
  is awarded **only** if that run prints `[TEST_PASSED] ral_hw_reset_test`.

Partial attempts (e.g. a `uvm_reg_block` declared but never used, no
backdoor, or `ral_hw_reset_test` missing) do **not** earn the RAL bonus.
They may still earn the UVM bonus if the UVM structural checks pass.

## 8. Forbidden practices

- Hardcoding the DUT source path (must use `DUT_SRC`)
- Short-circuiting tests based on `+define+FAULTY` or similar: the grader
  will compile with `+define+SIM` only
- Detecting the grader by hostname/username/env var
- Consuming more than 10 GB of disk or RAM during a single test
- Calling external services at test time

Violations void the bug-detection score.

## 9. Submission checklist

- [ ] Zip named `<name>_<id>.zip`
- [ ] `make compile` succeeds with the default `DUT_SRCS` (golden RTL)
- [ ] `make regress` finishes under the 10000-run cap
- [ ] `coverage_report.txt` produced and >= 85% on golden RTL
- [ ] `docs/test_plan.pdf`, `docs/final_report.pdf`, `docs/coverage_report.pdf`
      all present
- [ ] `README.md` lists simulator version, any non-default compile flags
- [ ] No binary simulator output files checked in (`*.wlf`, `work/`, etc.)
- [ ] If UVM bonus attempted: `make run_bonus` passes on golden and the
      RAL structural checks in Section 7 all hold.

## 10. SystemVerilog-only track (mandatory baseline)

UVM is **optional**. If you choose to stay in plain SystemVerilog, your
submission MUST still fit the Section 1 layout. The grader does not
treat SV-only and UVM submissions differently for the base rubric - only
the UVM and RAL bonuses are off the table.

Recommended organisation for an SV-only submission:

```
tb/
  tb_top.sv              # module (not a class) instantiating dut_wrapper
  apb_master_bfm.sv      # `program` or `module` that drives apb_if
  spi_slave_bfm.sv       # module that drives/monitors spi_if.slave
env/
  ref_model.sv           # `module` or `program` implementing the predictor
  scoreboard.sv          # pure SV scoreboard (queues + $error on mismatch)
  coverage.sv            # covergroups on APB, SPI, interrupt events
tests/
  sanity_test.sv         # `program` automatic; selected by +TESTNAME=...
  reg_access_test.sv
  mode_coverage_test.sv
  ...
sequences/
  stim_lib.sv            # reusable randomisable transaction classes
assertions/
  spi_sva.sv             # module bound to dut_wrapper via `bind`
```

`tb/tb_top.sv` MUST look roughly like this skeleton (full version is
shipped in `harness/examples/sv_only/`):

```systemverilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module tb_top;
  // clk / rst / interfaces
  bit PCLK = 0; always #5 PCLK = ~PCLK;
  bit PRESETn;
  apb_if apb (PCLK, PRESETn);
  spi_if spi ();

  dut_wrapper u_wrap (.apb(apb.slave), .spi(spi), .PCLK(PCLK), .PRESETn(PRESETn));

  // bind assertions (use the *instance path* of your dut_wrapper instance,
  // here `u_wrap`, NOT the bare module-type `dut_wrapper`)
  bind u_wrap.u_dut.u_regfile spi_sva u_sva (.*);

  // test dispatch: +TESTNAME=<name> selects which program to spawn
  string testname;
  initial begin
    PRESETn = 0;
    #50 PRESETn = 1;
    if (!$value$plusargs("TESTNAME=%s", testname)) testname = "sanity_test";
    case (testname)
      "sanity_test"          : sanity_test         :: run(apb, spi);
      "reg_access_test"      : reg_access_test     :: run(apb, spi);
      "mode_coverage_test"   : mode_coverage_test  :: run(apb, spi);
      // ... all ten required names ...
      default                : $fatal(1, "Unknown test %s", testname);
    endcase
    $display("[TEST_PASSED] %s", testname);
    $finish;
  end
endmodule
```

Key contract points for SV-only:

- The grader drives `+TESTNAME=<name>` AND `+UVM_TESTNAME=<name>`. Your
  TB MUST honour at least one of them; the template Makefile already
  passes both.
- Every test MUST end with exactly one `[TEST_PASSED]` or
  `[TEST_FAILED]` line as in Section 4.
- Scoreboards MUST signal mismatches via `[SCOREBOARD_ERROR] ...` lines
  (Section 4). `$error` is also accepted.
- SVA MUST live in a file that is bound into the DUT (e.g. via
  `bind u_wrap.u_dut.u_regfile ...` or at the `u_wrap.u_dut.u_core` level).
  Inline assertions inside the DUT are not counted because you cannot
  modify the DUT.
- `REGRESSION_TESTS` in the Makefile MUST list all ten required test
  names (Section 3). You may add more.

A ready-to-clone SV-only scaffold lives at
`harness/examples/sv_only/` (shipped with the starter kit). Start from
there if you are not using UVM.
