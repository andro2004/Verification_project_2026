# Final Project - SPI Master Controller Verification

Ain Shams University - Digital Design Verification - Spring 2026

This repository is what we hand to students as their **final project starting
point**. It contains:

- A specification PDF (`docs/SPI_Master_Spec.pdf`) describing the DUT.
- A golden RTL implementation of the DUT (`golden_rtl/spi_master.sv`).
- A fixed verification harness (`harness/`) that students must not modify.
- A grading contract (`harness/grading_interface.md`) that specifies exactly
  what the submission must look like.

Students do **not** receive `faulty_rtl/`, `reference_env/`, or `grading/`.
Those live in the course-staff copy only; they are used on our side to
swap in buggy DUTs and automate grading. See "Layout" below for details.

## What you are being asked to build

You receive a real SPI master IP (see `docs/SPI_Master_Spec.pdf`) and must
produce a SystemVerilog verification environment that:

1. Drives an APB master into the DUT to configure it (register writes/reads).
2. Models one or more SPI slaves attached to MISO/MOSI/SCLK/SS_n[3:0].
3. Predicts the correct behaviour for every APB and SPI transaction and
   reports a `[SCOREBOARD_ERROR]` whenever the DUT deviates from the spec.
4. Covers the full configuration space: 4 SPI modes x {MSB/LSB-first} x
   {8, 16, 32}-bit x a meaningful range of `CLK_DIV` and `DELAY` values x
   every interrupt source.
5. Contains at least 5 SystemVerilog assertions bound to the DUT.

Constrained-random stimulus, functional coverage, and SVA are **mandatory**.
UVM is **optional** and earns bonus points; UVM RAL earns further bonus.

The grader will run your regression against a version of the DUT that has
one of 30 seeded bugs active at a time, and will count how many of those
bugs your environment flags. See `harness/grading_interface.md` for the
exact contract.

## Layout (what students get)

```
final_project/
  README.md                    <- this file
  docs/
    SPI_Master_Spec.pdf        <- read this first
    generate_spec_pdf.py       <- reproducible source for the PDF
  golden_rtl/
    spi_core.sv                <- SPI shift engine sub-block (visible u_core)
    apb_regfile.sv             <- APB slave + registers + FIFOs (visible u_regfile)
    spi_master.sv              <- thin top that instantiates both sub-blocks
  harness/
    apb_if.sv                  <- APB SystemVerilog interface
    spi_if.sv                  <- SPI-side interface
    dut_wrapper.sv             <- wraps the DUT, binds interfaces
    Makefile.template          <- template Makefile to copy into your dir
    grading_interface.md       <- normative submission contract (MUST read)
    examples/sv_only/          <- ready-to-clone SV-only scaffold (no UVM)
```

The DUT is deliberately split into two sub-blocks that the testbench may
probe hierarchically:

```
dut_wrapper.u_dut
 +-- u_regfile : apb_regfile    (APB slave, 9 registers, TX/RX FIFOs, IRQ)
 +-- u_core    : spi_core       (SPI shift FSM, SCLK/MOSI/SS_n drive)
```

External pinout is unchanged; students MUST NOT modify the DUT. The
hierarchy is exposed so you can backdoor-peek registers and bind SVA
into either sub-block (`bind u_wrap.u_dut.u_regfile ...`).

## Layout (course-staff only, not distributed)

```
final_project/
  faulty_rtl/
    spi_core_buggy.sv          <- bugs scoped to the SPI core
    apb_regfile_buggy.sv       <- bugs scoped to APB/regfile/FIFO/IRQ/SS
    spi_master_buggy.sv        <- thin top wrapping the _buggy sub-blocks
  reference_env/
    spi_pkg.sv                 <- UVM agents + scoreboard + coverage
    spi_seq_pkg.sv             <- UVM sequences + tests
    spi_assertions.sv          <- SVA bound in tb_top
    tb_top.sv                  <- UVM top
    run.ps1                    <- helper to compile+run in Questa
  grading/
    bug_catalog.yaml           <- bug_id -> detection signature mapping
    bug_to_spec.md             <- bug_id -> spec clause + minimal stimulus recipe
    rubric.md                  <- authoritative grading rubric
    run_grading.py             <- swap DUT, run regression, emit score
```

The faulty RTL and bug catalog are not made available to students. All
randomisation and grading pressure is applied purely through the published
spec and the public harness.

## How to start

1. Read `docs/SPI_Master_Spec.pdf` end to end. It is 11 pages (one-page
   architecture appendix added in Rev 1.1); every requirement has a
   requirement-id tag like `R14` that you
   can cite in your test plan.
2. Read `harness/grading_interface.md`. It specifies the Makefile targets,
   the test names, and the log conventions the grader uses.
3. Copy `harness/Makefile.template` into your submission directory and
   rename it to `Makefile`. Fill in the simulator-specific sections if
   you are not using QuestaSim.
4. Instantiate the provided `dut_wrapper` in your testbench. Do not modify
   `harness/dut_wrapper.sv` or either interface file; the grader replaces
   `golden_rtl/spi_master.sv` with the faulty version and expects your TB
   to keep working.
5. Build a scoreboard and coverage model based on the spec, not on reading
   the golden RTL. The faulty RTL's bugs were picked specifically to hit
   behaviours that are spec-observable but only covered by well-crafted
   directed + random tests.
6. Write at least the 10 mandatory tests listed in
   `harness/grading_interface.md`. Add as many more as you like within the
   10000-run cap.

A good order of attack is: APB register access -> single-byte mode-0
transfer -> mode crossing -> width crossing -> FIFO stress ->
interrupts/W1C -> CLK_DIV corner cases -> loopback -> DELAY behaviour ->
error injection.

## Deliverables

Submit a single zip named `<name>_<id>.zip`. It must unpack to a top-level
directory named `<name>_<id>/` that follows the layout in
`harness/grading_interface.md` Section 1, and must include:

- `Makefile` inheriting the template's interface
- `tb/`, `env/`, `tests/`, `sequences/`, `assertions/` directories
- `docs/test_plan.pdf` - your test plan with covergroup + SVA inventory
- `docs/final_report.pdf` - bugs found, coverage numbers, lessons learned
- `docs/coverage_report.pdf` - the GUI export of your coverage results
- `README.md` - your simulator version and any non-default flags

The grader runs (roughly) this sequence inside your submission tree:

```bash
make clean
make compile DUT_SRCS="<spi_core_buggy.sv> <apb_regfile_buggy.sv> <spi_master_buggy.sv>"
make regress DUT_SRCS="..." REGRESSION_SEEDS=<N>
make cov
make run_bonus        # only if you opted into the UVM RAL bonus
```

with `|REGRESSION_TESTS| * REGRESSION_SEEDS <= 10000`. Any breach of that
bound zeroes the bug-detection category.

## SystemVerilog-only vs UVM

UVM is **optional**. Both workflows hit the same Makefile targets and
the same per-test log contract (`[TEST_PASSED]`/`[TEST_FAILED]`,
`[SCOREBOARD_ERROR]`, `[ASSERTION_ERROR]`). The differences:

| Area              | SV-only                           | UVM (optional)                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Top-level         | `module tb_top` with `+TESTNAME`  | `module tb_top` calling `run_test()` |
| BFMs              | `module` / `program` with tasks   | `uvm_driver` / `uvm_monitor`         |
| Scoreboard        | plain SV class, `[SCOREBOARD_ERROR]` | `uvm_scoreboard` with analysis ports |
| Coverage          | `covergroup` in a class           | `uvm_subscriber` with covergroup     |
| Backdoor checks   | hierarchical refs into `u_regfile`/`u_core` | `uvm_reg_block` backdoor via `add_hdl_path` |
| UVM bonus         | not eligible                      | +10 if structural checks pass        |
| RAL bonus         | not eligible                      | +5 if `ral_hw_reset_test` passes     |

A ready-to-clone SV-only scaffold lives at
`harness/examples/sv_only/`. Copy it, rename the test cases, and you
have a submission that already hits the Makefile contract. See that
directory's own `README.md` for details.

## Scoring summary (see `grading/rubric.md` on the staff side)

| Category             | Weight |
|----------------------|-------:|
| Mandatory tests pass | 10     |
| Coverage (>= 85%)    | 15     |
| Assertions           |  5     |
| Bugs caught (20/28)  | 60     |
| Report & test plan   | 10     |
| UVM bonus            | +10    |
| UVM RAL bonus        | +5     |

Full bug-detection marks require **20 of the 28** scored bugs to be flagged.
Every bug below 20 costs `60/20 = 3.0` points on a linear ramp. Catching
more than 20 does not lose points but is capped at full marks.

> Note: the project originally seeded 30 bugs. Two of them (BUG_E03 /
> BUG_E04) were retired from scoring because their faulty values self-heal
> within one PCLK and are not observable from any APB stimulus path. The
> staff-only file `grading/bug_to_spec.md` documents the analysis. The
> 20/28 threshold preserves the original ~83% difficulty bar.

## Rules and integrity

- You may work in teams of up to 3 people. Submit one zip per team.
- You may share experience **between** teams but not code. Reuse of code
  from another team counts as academic dishonesty.
- Do not attempt to detect the grader, short-circuit tests based on
  `+define+FAULTY`, or otherwise game the grading pipeline. See
  `harness/grading_interface.md` Section 8 for the full list of forbidden
  practices.
- If you discover ambiguity in the spec, file an issue on the class forum.
  We will issue a spec clarification (and potentially a spec patch) that
  applies to every submission.

## Acknowledgements

The SPI Master reference IP is an original teaching design created for this
course. It intentionally mimics the register layout of production-grade SPI
masters (e.g. the ones found in ARM MCUs) so that the verification lessons
transfer directly to industry.

Good luck. Catch bugs.
